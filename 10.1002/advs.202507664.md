## 📌 Overview
Dental hypersensitivity (DH) occurs when dentinal tubules are exposed due to enamel or cementum loss, causing pain from fluid flow that triggers pulp nerves.

**Limitations of Current Treatments:**
- Sensitive toothpaste / resins → only surface-level effect, requires reapplication.
- Lasers → risk of dentin damage, limited durability.

**Solution Introduced:**  
**CalBots** — magnetically controlled, calcium-based nanostructures that:
- Penetrate **>300 µm** into dentinal tubules.
- Form **biocompatible cement plugs** for long-term relief.

## 🧪 CalBots: The Technology
- **Structure:** Core–shell nanoparticle (~387 nm)  
  - Iron oxide core  
  - Silica shell  
  - Calcium silicate outer layer
- **Properties:**
  - Superparamagnetic
  - Biocompatible (GRAS materials)
  - Self-assemble into short chains under magnetic fields
- **Cementation Process:**
  - Suspended in CaO gel → transforms into calcium silicate hydrate
  - Solidifies into robust plugs in 2–20 hours

---

## ⚙ How It Works
1. **Magnetic Self-Assembly:**  
   External gradient magnetic field aligns CalBots into chains.

2. **Active Penetration:**  
   Chains navigate the micro-topography of dentinal tubules.

3. **In-situ Cementation:**  
   CalBots + CaO react to form impermeable, long-lasting plugs.

## 🔬 Experimental Highlights

### **In Vitro (Human Teeth)**
- Magnetic actuation → plug formation up to **300–500 µm depth**.
- **Micro-CT with silver nanoparticle contrast** quantified occlusion:  
  - ~90% tubules blocked near 500 µm depth.
- Dentine permeability reduced by **87.7%**.

### **In Vivo (Mice Model)**
- Developed **cold-water preference behavioral assay** for DH.
- CalBot-treated mice:
  - Recovered from cold avoidance in hours.
  - Relief persisted for at least 2 weeks.
- Controls remained sensitive.

### **Safety**
- No toxicity up to **550 mg/kg** in mice (OECD 425 protocol).
- No mortality, distress, or organ damage.

## 📈 Significance
- **First** integration of magnetic nanomanipulation with calcium silicate cementation.
- Long-term DH relief potential vs. transient surface coatings.
- Possible secondary benefit: **barrier to bacterial infiltration**.

---

## 🦷 Potential Clinical Workflow
1. Apply CalBot suspension to exposed dentin.
2. Use handheld/intraoral magnetic applicator (~1500 G/cm gradient) for **10–20 minutes**.
3. Allow cementation to proceed naturally over a few hours.

## 🚀 Future Directions
- Optimize magnetic delivery for dental clinics.
- Long-term in-mouth durability studies.
- Applications in:
  - Orthopaedics
  - Regenerative dentistry
  - Congenital anomalies
